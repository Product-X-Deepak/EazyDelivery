# Future Improvements for EazyDelivery

This document outlines planned improvements and technical debt that should be addressed in future releases.

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Deprecated API Replacements

- [ ] Replace all deprecated `onBackPressed()` calls with the new OnBackPressedCallback API
- [ ] Update all icon usages to use AutoMirrored versions where appropriate
- [ ] Replace deprecated Firebase APIs with KTX alternatives
- [ ] Update deprecated Android UI components with Material 3 equivalents

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement memory usage monitoring using PerformanceUtils
- [ ] Optimize image loading with proper caching strategies
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary object allocations in hot paths
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for heavy resources
- [ ] Add performance tracing for critical user journeys

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

- [ ] Standardize error handling using ErrorHandlingExtensions
- [ ] Implement proper error recovery strategies
- [ ] Add better error reporting to analytics
- [ ] Improve user-facing error messages
- [ ] Add offline error handling capabilities

### 4. Code Cleanup

- [ ] Remove unused parameters and variables
- [ ] Document intentionally unused parameters with @Unused annotation
- [ ] Fix redundant null checks and Elvis operators
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate code into shared utilities
- [ ] Improve code documentation

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Testing

- [ ] Increase unit test coverage to at least 80%
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical flows
- [ ] Implement UI tests for main user journeys
- [ ] Add performance regression tests

### 2. Dependency Injection

- [ ] Refactor remaining manual dependency creation to use Hilt
- [ ] Improve module organization
- [ ] Add proper scoping for dependencies

### 3. Modularization

- [ ] Split app into feature modules
- [ ] Create proper API boundaries between modules
- [ ] Implement dynamic feature delivery for rarely used features

## Security Improvements

- [ ] Implement certificate pinning for network requests
- [ ] Add runtime security checks
- [ ] Improve secure storage implementation
- [ ] Add tamper detection
- [ ] Implement proper key rotation

## Accessibility Improvements

- [ ] Ensure all UI elements have proper content descriptions
- [ ] Add support for screen readers
- [ ] Implement proper focus navigation
- [ ] Add support for larger text sizes
- [ ] Test with accessibility tools

## Internationalization

- [ ] Add support for additional languages
- [ ] Improve RTL support
- [ ] Add proper pluralization support
- [ ] Implement locale-specific formatting

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Short-term (1-3 months)**: Focus on critical deprecated API replacements and error handling improvements
- **Medium-term (3-6 months)**: Implement performance optimizations and increase test coverage
- **Long-term (6-12 months)**: Complete modularization and security improvements
